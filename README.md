# Greenplum Project Overview

## Introduction

This project is an end-to-end data processing and analytics initiative utilizing Greenplum at Sapiens Solutions. Our focus is to manage and analyze retail data comprehensively, incorporating various data sources like stores, traffic, bills, coupons, and promotional activities. The goal is to leverage Greenplum's capabilities for efficient data warehousing and analytics, ensuring timely and accurate insights for business decisions.

## Data:

* **Stores (stores)**: Contains details about retail outlets. This table will be loaded from a file using gpfdist from a local machine.
* **Traffic (traffic)**: Details about customer footfall in stores, updated hourly from counting systems. Loaded from an external PostgreSQL database via PXF.
* **Bills (bills_head, bills_item)**: Transaction data stored in two separate tables. These will be loaded from an external PostgreSQL database via PXF.
* **Coupons (coupons)**: Data on discount coupons used in transactions, loaded from a file using gpfdist.
* **Promotions (promos)**: Details of ongoing promotional activities, loaded from a file using gpfdist.
* **Promotion Types (promo_types)**: Types of promotions available, loaded from a file using gpfdist.

## Objective

* To replicate calculation processes using Greenplum.
* To understand query planning and execution in data warehousing, ensuring optimal performance.
* To load data marts into Clickhouse for efficient query processing.
* To create dynamic and insightful reports using Apache Superset.
* To automate data loading and mart creation using Apache Airflow, facilitating monthly/daily report generation.
